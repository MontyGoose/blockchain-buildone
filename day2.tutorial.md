Overview
==
Welcome to Day 2 of our learn by building a simple blockchain.  In this tutorial we're going to step it up a notch - and work on a Proof of Work algorithm and expose our blockchain as APIs.

As before ..

* I'm using Javascript because I like it.
* I am not advocating anything.
* This will have security/implementation holes.
* This is NOT a fully working blockchain solution.
* It's a bit of fun
* I found it useful to write, I hope you find it useful to read.

Enjoy (or not)

What is a Proof of Work algorithm
A Proof of Work algorithm is how new Blocks are created or mined on the blockchain - there are different ways to do this
